# The Prototype
SSH for life !

Team members: Essam, Badr, Ahmed

### Key Tasks:
1. **Group Formation**: Form a group of 3-4 members who wrote the same EDR in the first coursework.

2. **Prototype Development**: Choose one of the group’s EDRs and build a prototype to demonstrate its viability. The prototype should focus on the essential components of the design.

3. **Simulation**: Simulate other system parts that the prototype depends on (e.g., using hardcoded values, mock systems, or user input).

4. **Software Engineering Techniques**: Use appropriate techniques such as version control, testing, build automation, and continuous integration.

5. **Collaboration**: Work effectively as a team, leveraging strengths and supporting weaknesses, ensuring equal contribution from all members.

6. **Report Writing**: Submit:
   - A **200-word summary** of the chosen EDR and accomplishments.
   - An **800-word report** on the prototype’s development, highlighting team collaboration and software engineering practices.
   
7. **Individual Reflections**: Each member writes **250 words of constructive feedback** about every other group member.

### Assessment Criteria:
1. **Implementation of the Prototype (40%)**: 
   - How well does the prototype demonstrate the viability of the design?
   - Were challenges in the design addressed and solved during the prototyping process?
   
2. **Software Engineering Techniques (40%)**: 
   - Effective use of software engineering practices like version control, build automation, dependency management, testing, and continuous integration.
   
3. **Project Management (20%)**: 
   - Planning and breaking down work into manageable tasks.
   - Communicating progress and changes, updating tasks when necessary.
   - Ensuring all group members contribute appropriately.

### Submission:
- **Code repository** (with full history).
- **Report** (summary and detailed description of the prototype).
- **Individual reflections** on other group members' contributions.
