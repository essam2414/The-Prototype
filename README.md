# The Prototype
SSH for life !

Team members: Essam, Badr, Ahmed

There are two primary learning objectives against which your groupâ€™s submission
will be assessed against:

1. The implementation of the prototype: has your team successfully implemented
a prototype of the chosen design? How did you evaluate whether the prototype
demonstrates that the design is viable? If you determined that the design is not
viable, were you able to adjust the design and prototype? What is the overall
technical accomplishment?

2. Software engineering techniques: how well has your team applied software
engineering techniques? This includes both processes for working as a team
(planning, breaking down work, reporting on the progress, etc.) and the application of technical skills (version control, build automation, dependency
management, continuous integration and deployment, testing, etc.)
